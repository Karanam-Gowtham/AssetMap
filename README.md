**AssetMap — Project Description**

Assetmap is a static code analysis utility designed to automatically discover and catalog asset dependencies referenced within source code. When a user submits program code—such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, or similar files—Assetmap scans the content and extracts all locally referenced assets and internal links.

The tool identifies resources including images, stylesheets, script files, fonts, media files, and other file-based dependencies that are explicitly mentioned in the codebase. External CDN resources and third-party library links (for example, Bootstrap or hosted frameworks) can be excluded by design, allowing teams to focus strictly on project-owned assets.

Assetmap produces a structured inventory of these dependencies, enabling developers to:

* Understand asset usage and relationships across files
* Detect missing, unused, or incorrectly referenced resources
* Simplify refactoring, migration, or deployment processes
* Improve maintainability and consistency of project structure

In essence, Assetmap acts as a dependency visibility layer for static assets, helping developers map, audit, and manage their codebase resources with clarity and precision.
